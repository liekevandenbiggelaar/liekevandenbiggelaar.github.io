I'm a Data Scientist that wants to apply data mining for the greater good. After my bachelor Data Science and master Data Science & Artificial Intelligence I found that my passion lies with research. As of September 2024 I have started as a PhD Candidate in Data Mining at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I focus on generalizing Exceptional Model Mining techniques. My supervisors are [dr. Wouter Duivesteijn](https://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~wouter/) and [prof. Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/).
