Students are asked to explore scientific research in three different tracks, each covering a different data mining topics. The goal of this course is to bridge found knowledge gaps within these data mining topics and write a scientific paper on it. I am a lecturer in the exceptional model mining track together with the track coordinator and another colleague. I will give a lecture on how to go from Real-Life data to exceptional model mining applications during the lecture phase and I guide groups during the research phase.
