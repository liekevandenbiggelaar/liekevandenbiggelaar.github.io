excerpt: 'Channel state information offers the possibility to perform device-free gesture recognition without encountering major privacy issues. However, the use of WiFi-CSI for classification suffers from domain shift. Solving this issue with deep learning techniques is does not work optimally when the data that is as complex as WiFi-CSI. That is why a reinforcement learning structure is proposed. Multiple Deep Q-network methods are tested on WiFi-CSI data to measure to what extent rein- forcement learning can handle domain shift. With reinforcement learning, it would be possible to overcome the domain shift problem without having to built problem specific components for each new research design.'
