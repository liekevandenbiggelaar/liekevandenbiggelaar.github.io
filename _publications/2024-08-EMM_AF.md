This thesis is an exploratory study that characterizes atrial fibrillation during and after cardiac surgery using electrocardiogram morphology abnormalities in a transparent matter. Atrial fibrillation detection and prediction methods are black box methods that lack sufficient insights into their decisions, even though this aspect is important to gain the trust of the medical workers. Our aim to transparently identify unexpected risk factors for atrial fibrillation helps experts increase their understanding of the problem and assist in decision-making regarding administering preventative medication to risk groups. With the implementation of the exceptional model mining framework on time series constructed with anti-redundancy strategies, refinement strategies for all attribute types, and suitable quality measures specifically designed with the electrocardiogram morphology known for atrial fibrillation. Our version of the exceptional model mining framework suitable for time series has found several subgroups that align with existing research regarding risk factors of atrial fibrillation and is the basis for new hypotheses that are created based on newly found characteristics in the subgroup descriptions. For several of these subgroups, it has been advised to consider preventative medication.
